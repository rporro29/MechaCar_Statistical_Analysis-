## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Ground_clearance coefficients provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The P value is not queal or close to 0 is 5.35e-11; therefore, the value is not 0 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes it does predict the mpg effectively. The adjusted R-square of 0.6825 shows that this linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The variance for Lots 1 and 2 falls within the specified range. However, lot 3 fails at 170.2861224. Since this, the lots were chosen at random. It could be the reason why lot 3 doesn't meet the requirements.
